# SQL_Projects

This is where you'll be able to see my progress as I teach myself SQL. 
Currently, I host my own server that allows me to upload datasets and uses SQL to output the request from the code.
I would recommend copy/paste my code into a SQL compiler that allows you to preview how it looks.
