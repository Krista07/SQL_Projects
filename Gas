-- This is related to a dataset from Gas.
-- I have my own server that is called phpMyAdmin and it's using MariaDB. Some syntax maybe different depending on your DB.

-- Count all rows in the file
SELECT COUNT(Gas_Station) FROM `Gas`;

-- Count the total Gas stations by company name
SELECT Gas_Station, COUNT(*) AS 'Total' FROM `Gas` GROUP BY Gas_Station;
